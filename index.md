We’re an entirely student-run team at [Montgomery Blair High School](https://mbhs.edu/). We plan to submit a proposal for the 2018 CubeSat Launch Initiative ([CSLI](https://www.nasa.gov/content/about-cubesat-launch-initiative)) cycle, as part of NASA’s Educational Launch of NanoSatellites ([ELaNa](https://www.nasa.gov/content/about-elana)) program. Our satellite will measure charge density and high energy particle emissions in the ionosphere, contributing to radio propagation models and space weather research.

Help us get to space by donating to our [GoFundMe](https://www.gofundme.com/get-blair3sat-to-space)! If you want more information about our mission or you are interested in sponsoring us, please contact us at ryan.tse@blair3sat.com.
