We plan to measure ionospheric ion density, especially over the South Atlantic Anomaly, in order to develop a predictive model to advance the understanding of ionosphere weather and to inform satellite radiation shielding design.

### Ionospheric Plasma

The ionosphere is a region of the atmosphere that contains charged plasma. The charged material in this region can influence wireless communications, as the charged plasma can reflect or refract radio waves. This can affect long distance ground-based radio communication as well as ground-to-satellite radio communication. Also, areas with particularly high ion density can damage satellite electronics. 

Understanding and mapping the ion density of the ionosphere is currently a priority for scientists as it would allow us to adapt communications systems and satellite electronics to better handle this environment.

### SAA

The South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA) is a region of the ionosphere that has increased levels of radiation resulting from the offset of the geomagnetic pole and asymmetry in the Van Allen belts. Higher-than-usual flux of energetic particles in the SAA pose serious risks to both spacecraft electronics and astronauts.

Observation of daily fluctuations in the SAA combined with other geomagnetic data would allow improved understanding of the processes involved in the evolution of large-scale structures in the ionosphere, as well as a more accurate ionospheric model. Previous literature demonstrates the effectiveness of the OI 135.6 nm emission line to directly gauge ion density and therefore total electron content using emission intensity.

### Ionosounding

Ground-based RADAR devices called ionosondes measure charge density in the ionosphere by transmitting HF radio waves into the atmosphere and receiving the reflected and refracted waves, producing measurements called ionograms. These measurements may be used to extrapolate charge density information.

### CTIP

The Cubesat Tiny Ionospheric Photometer ([CTIP](http://mstl.atl.calpoly.edu/~bklofas/Presentations/SummerWorkshop2015/2_Geoff_Crowley.pdf)) designed by the Stanford Research Institute is a compact version of the TIP instrument originally developed at the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory. CTIP observes emissions at 135.6 nm with the use of SrF<sub>2</sub> and MgF<sub>2</sub> crystal filters to allow a narrow passband. Ionospheric ions emmit photons at this wavelength when excited by solar energy. Measuring photons at this wavelength gives information about the number of ions created below the aperture of the instrument.

### blair3sat Mission

blair3Sat plans to take ionospheric measurements with CTIP and by receiving vertical ionosonde soundings to map ionospheric charge information to precise geophysical location. blair3sat will primarily take measurements in the SAA. Blair3Sat will complement recent and upcoming missions such as the Ionospheric Connection Explorer ([ICON](https://www.nasa.gov/content/icon-mission-overview)), as well as ground-based measurements where those are possible. These observations will more thoroughly document daily variations in the ionosphere, in particular the SAA, allowing correlation and analysis with solar activity and contributing to the ionospheric model.
