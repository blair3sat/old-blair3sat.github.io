We plan to measure ion density in the South Atlantic Anomaly to develop a predictive model to advance the understanding of ionosphere weather and to inform satellite radiation shielding design.



### SAA

The South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA) is a region of increased levels of radiation resulting from the offset of the geomagnetic pole and asymmetry in the Van Allen belts. Higher-than-usual flux of energetic particles in the SAA pose serious issues for both spacecraft electronics and astronauts, and are a primary cause of radiation damage. Observation of daily fluctuations in the SAA combined with other geomagnetic data would allow improved understanding of the processes involved in the evolution of large-scale structures in the ionosphere, as well as a more accurate ionospheric model. Previous literature demonstrates the effectiveness of the OI 135.6 nm emission line to directly gauge ion density and therefore total electron content using emission intensity.

### CTIP

The Cubesat Tiny Ionospheric Photometer ([CTIP](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/2016JA022900)) designed by the Stanford Research Institute is a compact version of the TIP instrument originally developed at the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory. CTIP observes emissions at 135.6 nm with the use of SrF<sub>2</sub> and MgF<sub>2</sub> crystal filters to allow a narrow passband.

Blair3Sat will include CTIP along with an attitude determination and control system to record accurate geophysical information. Blair3Sat will complement recent and upcoming missions such as the Ionospheric Connection Explorer ([ICON](https://www.nasa.gov/content/icon-mission-overview)), as well as ground-based measurements where those are possible. These observations will more thoroughly document daily variations in the ionosphere, in particular the SAA, allowing correlation and analysis with solar activity and contributing to the ionospheric model.
